This dataset has a set of musical artists linked to similar musical artists based on the echonest database.

This was released as part of the million song dataset.

Raw data
--------

- <http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~thierry/artist_similarity.db>
- <http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/unique_artists.txt>

Building the graphs
-------------------

This was originally processed by David Gleich in 2014 from the files. (See the original notes.)

- <http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~thierry/artist_similarity.db>
- <http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/unique_artists.txt>

These were processed with the script `sim2smat.py`

The xy coordinates were generated by the drl algorithm in igraph. The code to do so (with references to the wrong file locations) is `generate_xy.jl`.

Files
-----

- `artistsim.smat` contains the directed graph of artist similarity relationships. The out neighbors (rows) are the artists displayed as similar. 
- `artistsim.labels` has the artist names
- `artistsim.xy` has a useful drawing in terms of the DrL algorithm
